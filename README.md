You can find the following files here:

- [hw05-plotly files.Rmd](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw05-albina23/blob/master/hw05%20-%20plotly%20files.Rmd) is an R markdown file containing code to generate plotly graphs. 

In this assignment, I will be working with the `gapminder` dataset to:
1. Reorder a factor
2. Write a dataset to file and load it back into R
3. Improve a figure using new knowledge 
4. Make a plotly visual
5. Implement visualization design principles.
